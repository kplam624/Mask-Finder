An application that lets the user know whether or not they are wearing a mask.

# BACKGROUND

With lockdowns being lifted, businesses returning to their physical stores and offices, schools reopening, indoor dining resuming at greater numbers, and folks just looking forward to some sense of normalcy, wearing masks still remain part of continued efforts to ensure the safety and well being of our citizenry. 

As part of continued efforts to combat COVID-19, we've created an applictaion that will allow users to detect whether or not someone is wearing a mask.
